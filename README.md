# FFT image compression python application
Application by applying the Fast Fourier Transform, removes a certain percentage of data from the image, and then saves the resulting image in a custom created format. Users can select the percentage to discard and view the result in different forms.

## Application navigation:

- Image: Screen allows the user to load the selected image into the application and select the level of the threshold value used for compression.

- Plots: Screen shows the original, compressed and plotted fft of the image in all three color channels.

- Statistics: Screen shows various measuring components to evaluate the image compression such as: original and compressed file sizes, compression time, compresstion ratio, mean squared error

- Information: Screen presents information about the application.
