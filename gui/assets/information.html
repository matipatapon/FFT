    <h1>Application</h1>
    <p>
        Application by applying the Fast Fourier Transform, removes a certain percentage of data from the image, and
        then saves the resulting image in a custom created format. Users can select the percentage to discard and view
        the result in different forms.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are four tabs:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Image: Screen allows the user to load the selected image into the application and select the level of the
            threshold value used for compression.
        </li>
        <li>
            Plots: Screen shows the original, compressed and plotted fft of the image in all three color channels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Statistics: Screen shows various measuring components to evaluate the image compression such as: original
            and compressed file sizes, compression time, compresstion ratio, mean squared error
        </li>
        <li>
            Information: Screen presents information about the application.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            We load a color image. Then we apply the two-dimensional Fourier transform for each color channel
            of the image.
        </li>
        <li>
            Values are sorted and only a fraction of frequncies determined by threshold are kept, the rest of the
            data is set to 0.
        </li>
        <li>
            The result is then applied to inverse fft algorithm and shown to the screen.
            Resulted image can be downloaded in our own format.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>What is FFT</h1>
    <h3>FFT</h3>
    <p>
        A fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence,
        or its inverse. A Fourier transform converts a signal from its original domain to a representation in the
        frequency domain and vice versa. Fourier Transform decomposes an image into its frequency components.
    </p>

    <h3>2d FFT</h3>
    <p>
        The two-dimensional Fourier transform of a matrix of data is achieved by first applying the one-dimensional
        Fourier transform to every row of the matrix and then applying the one-dimensional Fourier transform to every
        column of the intermediate matrix. The two-dimensional FFT is effective for image compression, because many of
        the Fourier coefficients can be discarded without losing significant image quality.
